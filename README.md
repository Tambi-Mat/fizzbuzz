# fizzbuzz

Fizzbuzz is a simple coding challenge, often described as a code kata. The objective of Fizzbuzz is to create a program with the following specification:

* The program can be passed a number.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message **'fizz'**.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message **'buzz'**.
* When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message **'fizzbuzz'**.
* In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.

## Method

The goal of the project was to introduce the developers to **Test Driven Development** (TDD) and Pair Programming. RSpec was used as the testing tool.
